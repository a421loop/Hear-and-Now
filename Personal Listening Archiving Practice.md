# Life in Sound Class Out of Class Activity

### The Goal
Explore your sonic world and explore how digital tools can support everyday sonic thinking with personally meaningful audio data.

### Time: Installation - 5 minutes and activity: 10 minutes to infinite:))
### What You're Collecting
Install the "Hear and Now" Chrome extension and use it as much as you want through 3-5 days. 
Each listening prompt you engage with becomes an entry in your personal audio archive, helping you practice "thinking with and by means of sound" rather than just thinking about sound.

### The Collection Process
1. Install the extension -- check readme please 
2. Every time you get a listening prompt and decide to listen or not, document what you heard in your **Sonic Listening Data Log**
3. Collect your activity over 3 to 5 days

### Your Sonic Data Log Format

This is totally upto you. The goal is for you to develop your own **listening/sonic archival practices.** 
An example 
For each listening session, I will record:
- **Date/Time:**
- **Location:** 
- **Prompt received:**
- **Sounds identified:** (list 3-5 specific soundsâ€”focus on mundane yet meaningful everyday sounds)
- **Sound qualities:** (spatial/temporal, visceral/material qualities you feel in your body)
- **Personal relevance:** (why these sounds matter to your daily life)


### Privacy 
For each entry in your sonic data log, consider and note:

**Privacy Level** (choose one):
- **Keep private** 
- **Share with Prof. W-B only** 
- **Share with research team**
- **Share with future students** 
- **Share publicly (no name)** 
- **Share publicly (with name)** 

### What You Turn In
Your complete Sonic Data Log in whatever medium works for your archival practice. **Please ensure that the you specify the privacy level of this submission.**
